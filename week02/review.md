my review: 

In terms of the five considerations I will review each one by one...


1:  understanding what you are doing before you do it is a basic common sense idea that many should have. In UX it is that essential idea but far more detailed. It is important to understand each design's purpose and why each one is being designed. Without this basic foundation of an idea it cannot come to fruition."before you start planning the solution, know the problem"

2:workflows and sketched are importnant ways of visualizing how one can see the ideas come to life. It is important to do this so that every developer and designer is on the same page on what the website will look like.

3:It is very important to get feed back from the prior steps so you don't go through with a design destined to fail.

4:I highly agree with this step on knowing your tools. I highly doubt if you are in a project that you will want to expirement with something new, as getting adjusted to something new will be difficult and waste time for you and your project members.

5:ultimatley the end product has to be fine tuned for the audience, without that tuning it will not be entirely fit for them

in conclusion I agree with all the points made in this article
